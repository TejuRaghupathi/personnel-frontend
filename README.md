#Purpose :
The main intention on working to develop this app is to refresh my react skills and developing this basic app has taken me around 2 working days.

#App info 
This application is created with a purpose where me and my housemates will be able to share information regarding our shared accomodation.
This app helps me to keep up with the info regarding when the rent is due
I have also integrated a weather library.

#componets.
Login feature where you can select forget password, in case of password reset.
this app provides register option where you can create an account and access the info present.
The housemates can login with their credentials to acces the info.
The info mostly present is about rent reminder at the moment.

#what I enhjoted the most:

This has been entirely a very good refresher development, although it seems to be basic, I enjoyed working with creating db on AWS, this is something different from what I usually does.
The highlighted interesting part of this project will be acheiving my immediate goal to remind oursleves of the rents due, as that has been a quite an issue for my housemates to keep up.
Integrating weather is very interesting as well.

#Further developments :

I'm willing to hhave the  be chatapp integration withh this app, so we can chat about our house chores or issues directly while on it.
I also would like to integrate a section where you can see the shared expenses and be updated about house wide spendings.
Will be working on Setting up an notification alert regarding upcoming rent info instead of logging in to check
Also with the Rent date, need to work with backend to automate the rentdate notification
